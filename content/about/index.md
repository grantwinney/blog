Is there anything more satisfying than trying to figure something out, _finally_ getting it, and then sharing it with someone else who will appreciate it? Or taking some piece of knowledge, passing it on to someone, and getting to witness their ["ah ha" moment](https://xkcd.com/1053/)?

![XKCD - https://www.xkcd.com/1053](xkcd10000.png)

For over a decade, I've been developing software in a variety of settings and industries, focusing primarily on C# and the .NET stack, but branching into React, Erlang, and whatever else the job calls for. I'm a constant learner with an appreciation for good docs, DevOps, and the Agile process. I enjoy a good challenge, producing clear and maintainable code, and sharing what I learn with others.

If you found something interesting and want to reach out, leave a comment on the article that brought you here or at the [bottom](#comments) of this page. And if something was really helpful and you'd like to thank me, [I won't turn down a cup of java](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fhnVUiB19)! â˜•

## Pet Projects

I don't have time for a lot of side projects, especially since each one requires some level of tlc forever to stay relevant, but I've got a few:

- [Generate Links for Headers](https://grantwinney.com/generate-links-for-headers/) (browser addon)
- [Hide Comments Everywhere](https://grantwinney.com/hide-comments-everywhere/) (browser addon)
- [GhostSharp](https://grantwinney.com/ghostsharp/) _(C#_ [_wrapper_](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-an-api-wrapper/) _around the_ [_Ghost API_](https://docs.ghost.org/api/)_)_
