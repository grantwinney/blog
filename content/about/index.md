Is there anything more satisfying than trying to figure something out, finally getting it, and then sharing it with someone else who will appreciate it? Or taking some piece of knowledge, passing it on to someone, and getting to witness their "ah ha" moment?

For over a decade, I've been developing software in a variety of settings and industries, focusing primarily on C# and the .NET stack, but branching into React, Erlang, and whatever else the job calls for. I'm a constant learner with an appreciation for good docs, DevOps, and the Agile process. I enjoy a good challenge, producing clear and maintainable code, and sharing what I learn with others.

If you found something interesting and want to reach out, leave a comment on the article that brought you here, or at the bottom of this page, or via this contact page. And if something was really helpful and you'd like to thank me, I won't turn down a cup of java! â˜•
