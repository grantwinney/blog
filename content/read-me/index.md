## Privacy

My policy on privacy? It's good! So in the interest of full disclosure:

- I use privacy-friendly, analytics-and-tracking-free [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/privacy) for comments.
- I partner with privacy-friendly [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/), who adheres to the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/).
- I ***don't*** feed the Google Analytics beast.
- I may (rarely) include affiliate links for products or services I find useful and want to share. They don't increase your cost, but using them helps me out. TIA.

## License / Fair-Use

### Text

Writing content takes a considerable investment of time, so please don't go beyond "[fair use](https://allendyer.com/how-copyright-law-affects-blog-posts/)". Excerpts and quotes are perfectly reasonable, but copying a whole post is not. In that case, please just link back to the original post on here.

Code that lives on GitHub will have its own license, but if it's mine then it's probably using the MIT license as well.
