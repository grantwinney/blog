# Privacy

My policy on privacy? It's good! So in the interest of full disclosure...

- I use [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/privacy) for comments.

- I'm partnered with [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/) to display small and unobtrusive, technical (mostly software development) ads. Unlike other ad networks, they strive to be privacy-friendly and adhere to the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/).

- I may occasionally include affiliate links for products or services I find useful and want to share. They don't increase your cost at all, and using them helps pay for the time I put into this blog. TIA.

# License

For those interested, and unless I note otherwise in individual posts, all of my code samples on here are licensed with the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), posted below. Use them for whatever you'd like, but give credit where it's due. Thanks!

# Cross-Posting

I've been asked a couple of times for permission to cross-post my content in different languages. I'm thrilled someone would find enough value in what I've written that they'd want to make it more available, but I'd ask a few things in return.

**Give me a heads up** _(before and after)_

If you'd like to translate and cross-post something you found valuable, either email me at "webmaster@\<this site>" or leave a comment under the post you're interested in, to get in touch. And when it's done, send me a link... I'd love to check it out!

**Link back to the original post**

When there's duplicate content across the web, search engines have a difficult time telling which was the original, potentially something we can both get penalized for. To avoid problems, specify the [canonical url](https://www.reliablesoft.net/what-is-a-canonical-url/) _(aka, preferred source or original url)_ of the content by placing the following in the page header:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="ORIGNAL-POST-URL">
```

Please place a block like the following somewhere too, either at the top or bottom of the post:

> The post <insert post title> was originally published on [https://grantwinney.com](https://grantwinney.com/). Grant writes whenever he has something to share - a personal project, a solution to a difficult problem, or just an idea. We learn by doing and sharing. We've all got something to contribute.

**Don't hotlink images**

If the post has images in it - _especially_ if it has a lot of images - I'd ask that you don't just hotlink back to the images hosted on my site Please host the images on your own server or with a third-party, and link to them there.

Thanks!
