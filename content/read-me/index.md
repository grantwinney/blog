## Privacy

My policy on privacy? It's good! So in the interest of full disclosure...

- I use [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/privacy) for comments.
- I'm partnered with [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/) to display small and unobtrusive, technical (mostly software development) ads. Unlike other ad networks, they strive to be privacy-friendly and adhere to the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/).
- I may occasionally include affiliate links for products or services I find useful and want to share. They don't increase your cost at all, and using them helps pay for the time I put into this blog. TIA.

## License / Fair-Use

### Text

Writing content takes a considerable investment of time, so please don't go beyond "[fair use](https://legalclarity.org/how-to-use-content-from-other-blogs-without-violating-copyright/)". Small excerpts and quotes are perfectly reasonable, but copying a whole post is not. In that case, please just link back to the original post.

### Code

Unless I note otherwise in individual posts, all code samples are licensed with the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) posted below. Use them for whatever you'd like, but give credit where it's due. Thanks!
