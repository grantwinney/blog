Penguin Random House is a book publisher, and their [API](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.biz/webservices/rest/) can be used to get data about books, authors and events. Let's check it out!

First though, two things to consider:

- If you're unfamiliar with APIs, you might want to [read this first](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-an-api/) to familiarize yourself.
- Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), which allows you to access API endpoints without having to write an app, as well as save the calls you make and sync them online.

Normally the first thing you have to worry about is some form of authorization and getting an API key. This API doesn't require or even offer it though, so... let's make some requests!

## Find Authors

Try looking up an author such as Isaac Asimov. You can specify a first and last name, and most likely you'll get multiple `author` records back - especially if you search for a popular name like "Smith" or something.

```
GET https://reststop.randomhouse.com/resources/authors?lastName=Asimov&firstName=Isaac
```

Here's a very small sample of the returned payload. You get the name back as well as an `authorid` (we'll use that in a moment), a short bio, and a list of titles (Asimov wrote a _lot_ of books).

```json
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<authors uri="https://reststop.randomhouse.com/resources/authors?lastName=Asimov&amp;firstName=Isaac">
    <author uri="https://reststop.randomhouse.com/resources/authors/947">

        <spotlight>&lt;b&gt;Isaac Asimov&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;began his Foundation series at the age of 21, not realizing that it would one day be considered a cornerstone of science fiction. During his legendary career, Asimov penned over 470 books on subjects ranging from science to Shakespeare to history, though he was most loved for his award-winning science fiction sagas, which include the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series. Named a Grand Master of Science Fiction by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Asimov entertained and educated readers of all ages for close to five decades. He died, at the age 72, in April 1992.</spotlight>

```

## Get Author Details

You can use the `authorid` value from the previous response (or just use the `uri` attribute of the `author` node) to get the details of the author you're interested in.

```
GET https://reststop.randomhouse.com/resources/authors/947
```

What I find interesting is that it seems to be the same data as the previous request. I'm not sure why, in order to make it faster, the previous endpoint doesn't return less data... maybe a few titles and works to make sure it's the right author in the event of some ambiguity.

```json

## Get Title / Work Details

The two responses so far have included the author's titles and works, of which I just showed a few (Asimov had hundreds). You can use that data with another endpoint to get more details about them. FWIW, I'm a little fuzzy on the difference between "titles" and "works"...

```
GET https://reststop.randomhouse.com/resources/titles/9780307490247
```

```json

## Thoughts

There's not too much to say about this one. Not sure what the limitations / request throttling might be for this API. It's free, which is nice! The documentation is all in one place and includes examples in php and java, which is nice too.
