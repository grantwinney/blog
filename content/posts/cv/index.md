I'm an experienced software developer with over 10 years in the computer software industry, and a self-starter and constant learner who always completes the task at hand. My focus has been on C# and the .NET Framework, with a passion for good documentation, continuous testing and builds, and the Agile process. I enjoy any good challenge as well as producing clear and maintainable code.

If something you see below or read on this site leads you to believe I'd be a good fit for a project or position you have in mind, I'd be interested in hearing about it. You can reach out using my contact page.

Mentor on Exercism

July - Nov 2018




As a mentor, I was able to help others learn more about C#. I get to meet them where they're at, and encourage them to take the next step... and in the process, I learned more too.











Contributor on Stack Overflow

July 2011 - Oct 2019




I enjoyed helping others by sharing what I'd learned. Platforms like Stack Overflow allow developers to help one another through the tough spots, and it was nice to give back once in awhile.









Writing

I feel that you don't really understand something until you can write about it clearly enough for someone else to learn. Here are a few posts that have been well received or I'm otherwise proud of.

 * A look at the many ways APIs can authorize access
 * Using AWS Lambda to tweet random blog posts from Ghost
 * Making Your First Chrome Extension
 * How to Unit Test using Visual Studio for Mac (it's easy!)


Projects

I've created a few open source projects. Some were personal challenges, others a fix for something I found suboptimal. The nice thing about being a programmer is knowing (or figuring out!) how to alter your online experience. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíæ
