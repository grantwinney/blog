title: Keep your EUnit teardown logic as simple as possible!
---
When you use [test fixtures](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/eunit#fixtures) in EUnit, you'll likely define a `setup` and a `teardown` function, for doing initialization and cleanup work before and after each test. If you're familiar with `try/catch/finally` blocks in other languages, the teardown function is similar to a `finally` block; that is, it should always run even when a test throws an exception. But like a `finally` block, you want to be careful about what you're doing in your cleanup.

I ran into an issue recently where EUnit tests that were part of a [test fixture](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/eunit#test-generators) were failing with an error I hadn't seen before. The error seemed to be coming from the [meck](https://github.com/eproxus/meck) mocking suite itself, and was reporting that it was "already_started"... and the tests would fail to run.

Here's a small program we can use to see the problem. All it does is accept a name, and print out a short greeting with the current time. _(The code below is trimmed down, but the_ [_full code is available on GitHub_](https://github.com/grantwinney/BlogCodeSamples/tree/master/Languages/Erlang/MeckTeardownTest) _if you'd like to run it. You'll want to have_ [_Rebar3_](https://www.rebar3.org/docs/getting-started) _installed, and it'd help to be familiar with_ [_Meck_](https://github.com/eproxus/meck)_.)_

```erlang
-module(salutations_app).
-export([greeting_time/1]).

greeting_time(Name) ->
    format("Hi ~s, it's ~s!", [Name, current_time()]).

%% INTERNAL

current_time() ->
    binary_to_list(iso8601:format(calendar:universal_time())).

format(Template, Params) ->
    lists:flatten(io_lib:fwrite(Template, Params)).
```

## Teardown succeeds, even when a test throws an exception

Here's the first example. Two of these tests intentionally throw exceptions - dividing by zero and sorting a non-list - but the `teardown` function should run regardless of whether individual tests throw an exception.

```erlang
-module(exceptions_in_tests).

-ifdef(EUNIT).

-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

-import(salutations_app, [greeting_time/1]).

setup() ->
    Modules = [iso8601],
    meck:new(Modules),
    meck:expect(iso8601, format, fun(_) -> <<"2019-02-16T01:06:48Z">> end),
    Modules.

teardown(Modules) ->
    ?debugFmt("Do we ALWAYS get into teardown? (yes)", []),
    meck:unload(Modules).

greeting_time_test_() ->
    {foreach, fun setup/0, fun teardown/1,
     [
      {"greet bob", fun bob_gets_expected_greeting/0},
      {"greet tim", fun tim_gets_expected_greeting/0},
      {"greet sue", fun sue_gets_expected_greeting/0}
     ]
    }.

bob_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    1/0,  % <- no good can come of this!
    ?assertEqual("Hi Bob, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Bob")).

tim_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Tim, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Tim")).

sue_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?debugFmt("Do we start the test? (yes)", []),
    lists:sort(this_aint_no_list),
    ?debugFmt("Do we finish the test? (no way)", []),
    ?assertEqual("Hi Sue, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Sue")).

-endif.
```

From the output below, we can see where `sue_gets_expected_greeting` printed the first debug statement, but not the second after the exception is thrown. Both exceptions are printed to the console. But the `teardown` function ran all three times, even for the tests that fail. 👍

## Teardown fails, when the teardown itself throws an exception

Here's the second example. Now the tests should pass, but the `teardown` function itself will throw an exception. The question is, what happens when it throws before the `meck:unload` runs?

```erlang
-module(exceptions_in_teardown).

-ifdef(EUNIT).

-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

-import(salutations_app, [greeting_time/1]).

setup() ->
    Modules = [iso8601],
    meck:new(Modules),
    meck:expect(iso8601, format, fun(_) -> <<"2019-02-16T01:06:48Z">> end),
    Modules.

teardown(Modules) ->
    ?debugFmt("Do we ALWAYS get into teardown? (well, the first time...)", []),
    _ = 1/0,
    meck:unload(Modules).

greeting_time_test_() ->
    {foreach, fun setup/0, fun teardown/1,
     [
      {"greet bob", fun bob_gets_expected_greeting/0},
      {"greet tim", fun tim_gets_expected_greeting/0},
      {"greet sue", fun sue_gets_expected_greeting/0}
     ]
    }.

bob_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Bob, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Bob")).

tim_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Tim, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Tim")).

sue_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Sue, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Sue")).

-endif.
```

Nothing good, as it turns out! _This_ is why I was seeing the "already_started" error - a previous `meck:unload` fails to run and the next test causes `meck:new` to run again. This example is silly, but what if you had some tests creating a file (yeah, yeah, against unit test philosophy but whatever) and wanted to delete it each time? What if one of those deletes failed and threw an exception? Every test after it fails too. 😭

## Teardown succeeds, as long as it handles exceptions

Oooookay, first let me say you should really refactor your `teardown` function to do as little as possible and make it simple. But if that's not possible, then at the very least surround anything that could potentially fail in a [try/catch/after block](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/errors-and-exceptions#dealing-with-exceptions). Here's one final example that catches exceptions and _guarantees_ that the `meck:unload` will run.

```erlang
-module(exceptions_in_teardown_handled).

-ifdef(EUNIT).

-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

-import(salutations_app, [greeting_time/1]).

setup() ->
    Modules = [iso8601],
    meck:new(Modules),
    meck:expect(iso8601, format, fun(_) -> <<"2019-02-16T01:06:48Z">> end),
    Modules.

teardown(Modules) ->
    try
        ?debugFmt("Do we ALWAYS get into teardown? (hopefully!)", []),
        _ = 1/0
    of _ -> ok
    catch
        C:R -> ?debugFmt("Teardown failed!!! ~p : ~p", [C,R])
    after
        ?debugFmt("Do we ALWAYS get into after block?", []),
        meck:unload(Modules)
    end.

greeting_time_test_() ->
    {foreach, fun setup/0, fun teardown/1,
     [
      {"greet bob", fun bob_gets_expected_greeting/0},
      {"greet tim", fun tim_gets_expected_greeting/0},
      {"greet sue", fun sue_gets_expected_greeting/0}
     ]
    }.

bob_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Bob, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Bob")).

tim_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Tim, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Tim")).

sue_gets_expected_greeting() ->
    ?assertEqual("Hi Sue, it's 2019-02-16T01:06:48Z!", salutations_app:greeting_time("Sue")).

-endif.
```

So now we have a `teardown` that should always run _and_ finish, thanks to an `after` block that runs `meck:unload` if all hell breaks loose. Granted, if it _did_ throw when it failed to delete a file, you might run into other issues... but one disaster at a time. 😎
