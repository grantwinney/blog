My policy on privacy? It's good! So in the interest of full disclosure...


Privacy / Tracking

I use services like Fathom Analytics and Hyvor Talk (for comments) to help make this site better and improve your experience, while also respecting everyone's privacy as much as possible.

The contact form provided by 123FormBuilder has its own privacy policy, which is only relevant if you use it to reach out to me.


Advertising

I partnered with EthicalAds to display small and unobtrusive, technical (mostly software development) ads. Unlike other ad networks, they strive to be privacy-friendly, show relevant products only, and adhere to the Acceptable Ads Standard.

Years ago I tried partnering with a typical ad network that went for quantity over quality. Never again. It was a frustrating couple of weeks trying to mess with their wonky tool that, no matter what, seemed to think my visitors wanted lingerie and colon cleansers.


Affiliate Links

I occasionally include affiliate links for products and services I find useful and want to share, although very rarely. Most of what I write about ain't sold on Amazon. When I do though, the links don't increase your cost at all, and using them helps pay for this blog and the time I put into it. TIA.
