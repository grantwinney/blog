My policy on privacy? It's good! So in the interest of full disclosure...

## Privacy / Tracking

I use [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/docs/gdpr) (for comments) to improve the site while respecting everyone's privacy as much as possible. I don't use any analytics software for the same reason I don't wear a FitBit.. I enjoy _doing,_ not counting.

## Advertising

I'm partnered with [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/) to display small and unobtrusive, technical (mostly software development) ads. Unlike other ad networks, they strive to be privacy-friendly, show relevant products only, and adhere to the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/).

## Affiliate Links

I may occasionally include affiliate links for products and services I find useful and want to share, although very rarely. Most of what I write about ain't sold on Amazon. When I do though, the links don't increase your cost at all, and using them helps pay for this blog and the time I put into it. TIA.
