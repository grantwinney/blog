My policy on privacy? It's good! So in the interest of full disclosure...

## Privacy / Tracking

I use [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/docs/gdpr) (for comments) to improve your experience while also respecting everyone's privacy as much as possible.

## Advertising

I partnered with [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/privacy-policy/) to display small and unobtrusive, technical (mostly software development) ads. Unlike other ad networks, they strive to be privacy-friendly, show relevant products only, and adhere to the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/).

Years ago I tried partnering with a typical ad network that went for quantity over quality. Never again. It was a frustrating couple of weeks trying to mess with their wonky tool that, no matter what, seemed to think my visitors wanted lingerie and colon cleansers_._

## Affiliate Links

I may occasionally include affiliate links for products and services I find useful and want to share, although very rarely. Most of what I write about ain't sold on Amazon. When I do though, the links don't increase your cost at all, and using them helps pay for this blog and the time I put into it. TIA.
