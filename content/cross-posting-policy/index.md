I've been asked a couple of times for permission to cross-post my content in different languages. I'm happy that someone would find enough value in what I've written that they'd translate it and open it to a larger audience, but I'd ask a few things of you first.

## Give me a heads up, before and after

If you'd like to translate and cross-post something you found valuable, either email me at "webmaster@<this site>", leave a comment under the post you're interested in, or [check out the Contact page](__GHOST_URL__/contact/) to get in touch. And when it's done, send me a link... I'd love to check it out.

## Link back to the original post

When there's duplicate content across the web, search engines have a difficult time telling which was the original, potentially something we can both get penalized for. To avoid problems, specify the [canonical url](https://www.reliablesoft.net/what-is-a-canonical-url/)  _(aka, preferred source or original url)_ of the content by placing the following in the page header:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="ORIGNAL-POST-URL">
```

Please place a block like the following somewhere too, either at the top or bottom of the post:

> The post <insert post title> was originally published on [https://grantwinney.com](__GHOST_URL__/). Grant writes whenever he has something to share - a personal project, a solution to a difficult problem, or just an idea. We learn by doing and sharing. We've all got something to contribute.

## Don't hotlink images

If the post has images in it - _especially_ if it has a lot of images - I'd ask that you don't just hotlink back to the images hosted on my site. Like everyone, my host has placed certain limits. Please host the images on your own server or with a third-party, and link to them there.

Thanks!
